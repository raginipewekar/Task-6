## üóÉÔ∏è Database Overview

The database consists of three tables (üì∑ *Refer to screenshots for exact table structures and sample data.*):

- `categories`: stores product category names.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Query Logic & Objectives

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery in `SELECT`
**Goal:** Show each product along with its total quantity sold  
**Logic:** A scalar subquery calculates `SUM(quantity)` from `sales` for each `product_id`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery in `WHERE` with Sorting
**Goal:** List product names with revenue higher than the average revenue of all products, sorted in descending order  
**Logic:** A derived table in `FROM` calculates total revenue per product, which is then filtered and ordered.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Subquery in `FROM`
**Goal:** Show total sales grouped by product category  
**Logic:** A subquery joins `sales`, `products`, and `categories`, then groups by category and sums up the total amount.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Correlated Subquery
**Goal:** Show products priced above the average price of other products in the same category  
**Logic:** For each product, a correlated subquery calculates the average price (excluding itself) for the same category.
